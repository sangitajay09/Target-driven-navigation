# Target-driven-navigation

CS 6301 Introduction to Robot Manipulation and Navigation Project to navigate to the desired object using BFS, built under Ai 2 THor, The AI2Thor scenes are converted into a grid world using the x and z axis (top view). All calculations are done based on the grid settings. The grid size can be changed and the grid size used for this project is 0.25m. The agent uses a breadth first search algorithm to traverse in the shortest path. The algorithm would compute the shortest path and then traverse, if it is unable to find the list of appliances it would terminate. The input to the algorithm would be a location of all targets that needs to be identified and mapped. Further, using Breadth First Search, the agent would then find the shortest path to the target and then traverse. This process would include identifying and avoiding obstacles that would appear in the environment
